Meet other developers and ops engineers using Docker. Docker is an open
platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed
applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime
and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications
and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from
components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and
production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same
app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.
